# Display Rate Currency

in this small project called Display Rate Currency
I used REACT + VITE
TAILWIND

 This project uses 3rd party API from (https://currencyfreaks.com/) and displays currency based on the value of 1 USD.

- Currency = the name of the currency
- We Buy = the value is 5% greater than the Exchange Rate
- Exchange Rate = the exchange rate obtained from the API, and
- We Sell -= the value is 5% smaller than the Exchange Rate
