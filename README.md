# Display Rate Currency

in this little project called Display Rate Currency
I used REACT & VITE
TAILWIND

and this is the example https://currency-rate-app.netlify.app/

 This project uses 3rd party API from https://currencyfreaks.com/ and displays currency based on 1 USD value.
You can fill in your API code in .env

- Currency      = the name of the currency
- We Buy        = the value is 5% greater than the Exchange Rate
- Exchange Rate = the exchange rate obtained from the API, and
- We Sell       = value 5% smaller than the Exchange Rate
